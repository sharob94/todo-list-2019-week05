<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

<span>Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>

<p> To begin I first pseduo coded what the user should see which included a form and 3 buttons. Next I focused on getting the buttons to work and properly remove the targeted items. I did this by adding classes to each element and then removing the  classes. I lastly added a portion of css which allows the user to click on the added to-do item and show a line-through that item.</p>
